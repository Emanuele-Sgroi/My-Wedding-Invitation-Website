## Description

I created this website for my wedding, but it can be used as a template for anyone (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md)). This multilingual wedding website (currently supporting English, Italian, and Polish) includes several features such as RSVP functionality, a password-protected registry section for bank details, a music suggestion feature integrated with Spotify, and an admin panel to manage your guest list and more.

### Features

This multilingual wedding website template is designed for an elegant and modern user experience, covering all essential aspects of a wedding event. Below are some of the key features:

- **Welcome Section**: full-screen hero section featuring the couple's photos, names, and a countdown to the wedding day.
